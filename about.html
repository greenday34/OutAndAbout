        <h2>About my CIS155 Spring 2019 Project, Francesca Avellina</h2>
        <h2>V4 Project</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The form in on the Planning Adventure page, which is new for V4.</li>
            <li>The checkboxes and radio buttons were dificult to style.</li>
            <li>The Reset button clears the form and the Submit button would pass the entires to the server.</li>
            <li>I would use Javascript for this as well as for producing a printable version of the form once it 
                is filled out.</li>
            <li>The CSS styling for the form produces a nice layout for the form. Without it the form would have
                a stack of elements.</li>
            <li>The audio element is on the Beaches Page. It came from the National Parks website.</li> 
            <li>The  video elements are on the Parks Page. I embedded a video taken in the Hoh Rainforest and used 
                an iframe from the State Parks website. </li> 
            <li>The animation is on the Dog Page. It is of an image of my dog taking a walk. I could not link the on/off 
                checkboxes without using Javascript. This will be added later with some images from Photoshop of the 
                transformation of the dog's tail and legs.</li>
            <li>I didn't use transforamtions since I didn't want to change any of my links.</li>
            <li>The sub-navigation bar was added and would work better if my pages contained more content. 
                The links go to a specific part of each page.</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h2>V3 Project</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The media queries are in the op_styles file for small, medium and large format screens.</li>
            <li>The navigation is stacked vertically and enlarged for better touch access. The images are hidden.</li>
            <li>The footer and header are present in condensed size.</li>
            <li>I have changed some of the layout and content of the pages for better presentation, but I am still 
                working on putting things where I think they should be.</li>
            <li>The flexboxes are on the Dog Friendly page.</li>
            <li>The flex containers are the sections and the flex items are the images.</li> 
            <li>The layout is not exactly as I would like it since the pictures are too small and the section is 
                not centered. </li> 
            <li>The table is on the Parks page. There are 5 columns and 6 rows with a footer row underneath the table.</li>
            <li>The styles for the table are similar to the page colors.</li>
            <li>The navigation bar under the top picture needs to be centered.</li>
            
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h2>V2 Project</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Website contains 6 pages, index.html, ports.html, beaches.html, parks.html, dogs.html and about.html and 2 stylesheets, op_styles.css and op_reset.css.</li>
            <li>There is a top header and navigation list on each page.</li>
            <li>The footer contains an address.</li>
            <li>There are sections below the main navigation list with articles about the selection</li>
            <li>I haven't figured out if the list in these sections will remain in these articles with links or just facts.</li>
            <li>The color styling is not finished and the layout is very simple using the techniques in the first 2 chapters.</li> 
            <li>On the main page there is a map with links to the different topic pages.</li>
            <li>The layout does not work very well right now. I am still working on lauout and styling</li>
            <li>Each page has a background image of greenery.</li>  
            <li>The navigation bar under the top picture needs to be centered.</li>
            <li>Figure caption is not displaying above or below figure and text is not next to figure. This needs to be improved.</li>
            <li>The linear gradient on the Beaches page is not working well and I will work on this.</li>
            <li>The images on the Beaches page are not diplayed well and the caption for the lower picture is not aligned by the image.</li>
            <li>The map links work, but I do not have pictures or text over the map to let the viewer knw which link is being chosen. </li>
        </ul>
