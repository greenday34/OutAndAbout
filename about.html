     <h2>V3 Project</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The media queries are in the op_styles file for small, medium and large format screens.</li>
            <li>The navigation is stacked vertically and enlarged for better touch access. The images are hidden.</li>
            <li>The footer and header are present in condensed size.</li>
            <li>I have changed some of the layout and content of the pages for better presentation, but I am still working on putting things
                where I think they should be.</li>
            <li>The flexboxes are on the Dog Friendly page.</li>
            <li>The flex containers are the sections and the flex items are the images.</li> 
            <li>The layout is not exactly as I would like it since the pictures are too small and the section is not centered. </li> 
            <li>The table is on the Parks page. There are 5 columns and 6 rows with a footer row underneath the table.</li>
            <li>The styles for the table are similar to the page colors.</li>
            <li>The navigation bar under the top picture needs to be centered.</li>
            
        </ul>

    <h2>V2 Project</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Website contains 6 pages, index.html, ports.html, beaches.html, parks.html, dogs.html and about.html and 2 stylesheets, op_styles.css and op_reset.css.</li>
            <li>There is a top header and navigation list on each page.</li>
            <li>The footer contains an address.</li>
            <li>There are sections below the main navigation list with articles about the selection</li>
            <li>I haven't figured out if the list in these sections will remain in these articles with links or just facts.</li>
            <li>The color styling is not finished and the layout is very simple using the techniques in the first 2 chapters.</li> 
            <li>On the main page there is a map with links to the different topic pages.</li>
            <li>The layout does not work very well right now. I am still working on lauout and styling</li>
            <li>Each page has a background image of greenery.</li>  
            <li>The navigation bar under the top picture needs to be centered.</li>
            <li>Figure caption is not displaying above or below figure and text is not next to figure. This needs to be improved.</li>
            <li>The linear gradient on the Beaches page is not working well and I will work on this.</li>
            <li>The images on the Beaches page are not diplayed well and the caption for the lower picture is not aligned by the image.</li>
            <li>The map links work, but I do not have pictures or text over the map to let the viewer knw which link is being chosen. </li>
        </ul>
